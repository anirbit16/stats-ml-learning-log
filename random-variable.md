# Random Variables
## 1. What is a random variable?
A **random variable** is a variable whose value is determined by the </br>
by the outcome of a random process.</br>

Instead of being fixed, its value is uncertain until the experiment happens.
Examples:
- Rolling a die → outcome is uncertain before the role.
- Tossing a coin → outcome is uncertain.
- Daily rainfall → varies from day to day.
Examples:

## 2. Why it matters
Random variables are the foundation of:
- **probability distributions** (PMF/PDF)
- **expectation (mean)** and **variance**
- **modelling uncertainty** in data science and ML </br>

Most real-world datasets can be seen as samples generated by random variables.

## 3. Types of random variables

### A) Discrete random variable
Takes **countable** values usually,integers.</br>
Examples:
- Number of heads in 10 coin tosses: 0, 1, 2............10
- Dice outcome: 1,2,3,4,5,6
