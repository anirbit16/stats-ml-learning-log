# Population Vs Sample
## Understanding
**Population** is the full set of individuals or items we want to study.
**Sample** is a smaller subset taken from the population to draw conclusions about the whole.
## Example
**Population** : All students in the school  
**Sample**: 100 students randomly selected from different classes
## In Machine Learning
In real-world ML, the model is trained on sample data with the goal that it performs well on the population data.
