# Mean
## 1. Defination
Mean is the average value of a dataset.
It gives a central value by summing all the observations and dividing by the total count.

Formula: 

**mean = sum of values / number of values**

## 2. Why it matters

Mean gives a single number that gives the overall level of the data.
It's the simple measure to tell "how high or low, on average" the values are.

## 3. Example (simple)
Marks: 70, 80, 90

Mean = (70 + 80 + 90)/3

Mean = **80**

So on average, the student scores 80.

## 4. When it fails (simple idea)
If one value is extremely high or low,mean becomes misleading, because it gets pulled by extremes.

Examples:
20, 22, 23, 25, **300**

Mean=78

But most values are 20-25

## 5. In ML
Mean is mostly used to fill missing values,when data is clean and does not have missing values.
For skewed data,median is safer
