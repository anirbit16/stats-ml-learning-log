# Range
## 1. Defination
Range is the simplest measure of dispersion.</br>
It tells out how spread out the data is by subtracting the smallest value from the largest value.

Formula: </br>
**Range = Maximum value - Minimum Value**

## 2. Why does it matter?
Range gives a quick idea of how widely the data values vary.</br>
Although it is simple, it is extremely sensitive to outliers.

## 3. Example
Data: 10, 12, 14, 18, 100 </br></br>
Min: 10  </br></br>
Max: 100  </br></br>
Range: **100-10 = 90**  </br></br>
Most values are around 10-20,so the large range is caused by the outlier (100).

## 4. Limitations
Limitations: Range doesn't tell us about the spread of values in between
