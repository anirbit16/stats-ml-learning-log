# Range
## 1. Defination
Range is the simplest measure of dispersion.</br>
It tells out how spread out the data is by subtracting the smallest value from the largest value.

Formula: </br>
**Range = Maximum value - Minimum Value**

## 2. Why does it matter?
Range gives a quick idea of how widely the data values vary.</br>
Although it is simple, it is extremely sensitive to outliers.

## 3. Example
Data: 10, 12, 14, 18, 100 </br></br>
Min: 10  </br></br>
Max: 100  </br></br>
Range: **100-10 = 90**  </br></br>
Most values are around 10-20,so the large range is caused by the outlier (100).

## 4. Limitations
Range doesn't tell us about the spread of values in between.</br>
Two datasets can have same range but completely different spreads.

Example:
- A: 10, 11, 12, 13, 100
- B: 10, 50, 60, 70, 100

Both have ranges=90, but spreads are very different

## 5. Limitations
Range helps us identify potential outliers and guide potential decisions about scaling.</br>
However due to it's sensitivity it is rarely used as a statistical measure.
