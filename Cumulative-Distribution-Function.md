# Random Variable
A random variable is a numerical quantity whose value depends on the </br>
outcome of a random process.

Random variables allow us to:
- assign numbers to uncertain outcomes
- define probabilities mathematically
- describe distributions

Random variables can be:
- discrete (countable values)
- continuous (any value within a range)

# Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
## What is CDF?
The cumulative distribution function (CDF) gives us the probability that a </br>
random variable takes a value less than or equal to x.

Formally, it answers:

**P(X ≤ x)**

For continuous distributions, probablity is accumulated </br>
over a range, not a single point.

 ## CDF in plain english
 CDF can be interpreted as a **running total of the probability** from the far left of the </br>
 distribution, to the far right of the distribution.
 - Far left probability → 0
 - Far right probability → 1

 As `x` increases, the CDF **never decreases**.
