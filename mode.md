# Mode
## 1. Defination
Mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset.

It represents the most common or the most popular value.

A Dataset can be:
- **unimodal** → one mode
- **bimodal** →  two modes
- **mulitmodal** → more than 2 modes
- **no modes** → All values occur with same frequency

## 2. Why it matters
Mean is the only measure of central tendency that works for **categorical data**.

Mean and median cannot be used together for categories, but mode tells you the most common category directly.

## 3. Examples
### 3.1 Numerical example

Data: 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 9

Mode = **6** (highest frequency)

### 3.2 Categorical example

Data: "M","M","L","S","M"

Mode= **M** (highest frequency)

### 3.3 Multimodal example

Data:  10,10,20,20,30

Mode= **10 and 20** (highest frequency)

## 4. When mode wins
Mode is useful when:
- data is **categorical**
- you want the most common preference/choice
- numbers don't have meaningful averages
   (e.g., mobile brand, city name, shirt size)
  
## 5. In ML
Mode is commonly used to fill missing values in categorical features.  
It preserves the most common category and avoids introducing new or misleading values.
