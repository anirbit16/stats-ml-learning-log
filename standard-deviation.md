# Standard Deviation
## 1. Defination
Standard deviation measures the typical distance from the mean. </br>
It is the square root of the variance and is expressed in **original units** of data.</br>
In simple terms, it means **how far values deviate from the mean**

## 2. Why standard deviation exists?
Variance measures spread but is interpret to spread because it uses **squared units**.</br>
Standard deviation fixes this by converting variance back to **original units**.</br></br>
This makes spread easier to interpret and communicate.

## 3. Relationship with variance
Standard deviation is defined as:

$$
\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}
$$

Where:
- σ² = variance  
- σ = population standard deviation </br>

Variance focuses on mathematical convenience while standard deviation focuses on human interpetability
