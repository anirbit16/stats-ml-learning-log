# Normal Distribution
## 1. What is normal distribution?
A normal distribution is a continous probability distribution in which data is </br>
symmetrically distributed around a central value.It has a bell-shaped curve and </br> commonly
arises in natural and measurement-driven phenomena.</br>

In a normal distribution:
- Mean = median = mode

## 2. Why is normal distribution important?
Normal distribution because many small independent random effects </br>
combine to produce it. This intuition is often associated with central </br>
limit effect.

It is commonly observed in:
- heights and weights
- measurement noise
- exam scores
- residual (errors) in regression models
  
## 3. Parameters of normal distribution
A normal distribution is defined by 2 parameters:
-  **μ (mu)** → mean, which determines the center of distribution </br>
-  **σ (sigma)** → standard deviation, which determines the spread of deviation

## 4. Shape and symmetry 
- The distribution is perfectly symmetric about mean.
-  Left and right are mirror images </br></br>

   Tails extend indefinetly, but probabilities decrease rapdily way from the mean.</br>
   This symmetry makes the mean and standard deviation reliable descriptive measures.
