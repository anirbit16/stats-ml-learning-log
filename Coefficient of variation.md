# Coefficient of variation
## 1. Defination
Coefficient of variation measures the relative spread of data with respect to the mean.</br>
It expresses variability as a ratio or percentage.

## 2. Formula
Coefficient of variation is defined as:

$$
\mathrm{CV} = \frac{\sigma}{\mu}
$$

Where:
- σ = standard deviation  
- μ = mean

It is often expressed as a percentage.

## 3. Example
Mean = 50 </br></br>
Standard Deviation = 10 </br></br>
Coefficient of Variation = 10/50 = **0.2** or **20%** </br>

## 4. Why is CV useful?
Standard deviation cannot used alone to compare datasets with different means and units.
Coefficient of variations allows **fair comparison of variability** accross datasets. </br>

## 5. Interpretation
- Lower CV → More Consistent Data
- Higher CV  → More variability relative to the mean

   CV focuses on relative dispersion, not **Absolute Dispersion** </br>
   
## 6. Interpretation
CV helps helps to compare feature variability accross different scales. </br>
It is useful in explorartory data analysis before feature selection or normalization. </br>
